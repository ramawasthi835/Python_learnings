print('''I am worried about tentacles.
How you can still get stung
even if the jelly arm disconnects
from the bell. My husband
swims without meâ€”farther
out to sea than I would like,
buoyed by salt and rind of kelp.
I am worried if I step too far
into the China Sea, my baby
will slow the beautiful kicks''')
